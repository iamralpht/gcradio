But that could change in Sochi, Russia, in February. The team has a secret weapon: a pristine glacier high above the mountains of Anchorage. On the ground, it's summer. But as soon as the helicopter crests the mountain: winter. The snowy white Eagle Glacier stretches out for miles, rimmed by rocky peaks. Alaska Pacific University runs training camps on the glacier every summer for its Olympic development team and other elite cross-country skiers. The athletes spend a week at a time on the glacier, sleeping and eating in a dorm that sits on shale rock just beyond the snow. They put in long hours skiing each day. Coach<strong> </strong>Erik Flora stands at the edge of the course, offering pointers to skiers during a practice speed relay. He yells \"go, go, go, go!\" as the skiers begin to practice. The glacier course is carefully probed to make sure there are no crevasses underneath. Flora designed it to mimic the Olympic venue in Russia. The snow is soft, sugary and wet after baking in the summer sun. It's not exactly first-rate skiing. But when the team had a chance to test the Sochi course during the World Cup last winter, it felt very familiar, says Alaska Pacific University skier Kikkan Randall. \"We all kind of looked at each other and went, 'This looks just like Eagle Glacier snow,' \" she says. \"So I think even though it's maybe not the most glorious conditions to ski in, learning how to be technically efficient in this kind of softer snow is going to help us out tremendously. And then if you've done your good work, you just get out there and do what you always do, and hopefully it's a gold medal moment.\" Randall is the best sprint cross-country skier in the world and the favorite for a gold medal in Sochi. A decade ago, a top 30 finish for the U.S. was a cause for celebration. Now, a handful of the U.S. women could medal at next year's Olympics. The team proved its depth last winter when it won bronze in a four-person relay at a World Cup event in Sweden. That was an incredible moment, says Anchorage skier Holly Brooks. \"It's funny because you go around town and people are like, 'Yeah, that race you guys won.' And it's like, 'Well, actually we didn't win, we got third,' \" she says, \"But in our minds we won because nothing like that had ever happened before.\" If the U.S. team does bring home an Olympic medal, Eagle Glacier can take some credit. It's one of the few places in the world where cross-country skiers can train on snow in the summer. The weather can be awful. The glacier attracts fog and clouds, along with wind, sleet, rain and snow. But Coach Flora sees that as an asset, says Brooks, since so many of the most important ski races happen in horrible weather: \"Erik's favorite thing to say when it's crappy outside: 'Guys, it's championship day!' \" she says. At the practice championship relay on the glacier, the skiers cross the finish within seconds of each other. As they catch their breath, Flora scoops up an armload of snow and begins an impromptu awards ceremony. \"And in first place, being awarded a massive piece of Eagle Glacier ice ...\" he says. The skiers don't get much time to enjoy their victory, though. Flora quickly has them back out on the course, putting in more training time on Eagle Glacier.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 Alaska Public Radio Network.

Health officials in Iowa and Nebraska are blaming salad greens for making <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/outbreaks/investigation-2013.html\">hundreds of people</a> sick with a parasite called cyclospora. That parasite usually comes from the tropics, so it's likely the salad did, too. Earlier this summer, pomegranate seeds from Turkey were <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2013/a1b-03-31/index.html\">linked</a> to an outbreak of hepatitis A. Last week, the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm362610.htm\">announced</a> a plan to prevent such problems. Michael Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, said that the hepatitis outbreak showed exactly why new rules are needed. \"That sort of incident is exactly the sort of problem that this new system is intended to address,\" he said. But the case of the poisoned pomegranates actually teaches a more complicated lesson: That safety systems, however helpful, are not foolproof. The outbreak began in the spring and mainly affected consumers in Western states. Michael Walters, who lives in Foxfield, Colo., first felt symptoms while visiting Yellowstone in late May. Walters had been on a health kick. He was eating superfoods: smoothies made from spinach, kale and avocado. To add a bit of sweetness, he added some frozen berries \u2014 a product called Organic Antioxidant Blend \u2014 that he picked up at Costco. \"I was really loading up on what I thought were very healthy, natural kinds of foods,\" he says. The disease hit with a feeling of overwhelming fatigue. Walters didn't know it yet, but more than 100 other people were getting it, too. And investigators found a link between them. They'd all bought that frozen berry mix. Costco recalled the product. Walters' daughter saw the warning on the Internet and called her sick father. \"We went online to the Costco website. They had a picture of the product,\" recalls Walters. \"We went to our freezer. There was the bag!\" Walters ended up in the hospital for four days. Today, two months later, he's still trying to get his strength back. In that bag of frozen berries, only one thing came from a part of the world where you find this strain of hepatitis A: pomegranate seeds from Turkey. So how will the FDA's new rules try to prevent this sort of thing? FDA officials describe their proposal as a fundamental shift in approach. Instead of just trying to catch contaminated food at the border, they'll require safety checks throughout the supply chain, all the way back to the fields and orchards overseas. If the rules go into effect, U.S. companies that import food will be legally required to show proof that their foreign suppliers are operating just as safely as suppliers in the U.S. \"It really boils down to expecting our importers to know their supplier, to know the food and its potential hazards, and to verify that preventive steps had been taken to minimize those hazards,\" says the FDA's Taylor. But here's the twist in the pomegranate story: The companies that imported the pomegranates apparently were doing exactly this already. Costco requires that its suppliers are audited for safety by outside experts. So does Townsend Farms, the Oregon company that actually packed the berry mix. And the Turkish processing plant that handled these pomegranates was following the rules of an international code of safety called <a href=\"http://www.saiglobal.com/Assurance/food-safety/GMA-SAFE.htm\">GMA-SAFE</a>. <a href=\"http://cit.msu.edu/faculty/Bourquin.html\">Les Bourquin</a>, a professor of food science at Michigan State University, has encountered GMA-SAFE frequently while working with food companies in foreign countries, helping them to develop food safety systems. He says that this certification generally satisfies the FDA's demands. \"It may not hit all the points of the new requirements, but it would be close,\" he says. Bourquin says we don't know yet exactly how this contamination happened \u2014 whether the safety rules weren't good enough or whether somebody broke the rules. But it's a reminder that it's really hard to guarantee safety in a system that stretches from pomegranate orchards in Turkey to your local grocery store. \"Failures do occur, even in good companies that are doing a very good job,\" he says. Still, Bourquin says, the FDA's proposed rules will have a big impact, especially on companies that have not been insisting on safety audits at their foreign suppliers. \"There are companies that don't do this,\" he says. The FDA rules \"will make some companies take it much more seriously.\" Even companies that are carrying out safety audits and testing, Bourquin says, like the plant in Turkey, can always find ways to do it even better.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

Rather, the designers boasted of its usability \u2014 that the Moto X has a larger purpose: making the technology of a phone adapt to the way people use them, rather than force user behavior to adapt to the technology. For example, if the phone is placed face down and then turned over, it briefly exposes the time, text and any email notifications without getting unlocked. And the Moto X is designed with rounded edges so it's comfortable in the hand. Gesture-control also becomes prominent. By twisting it back and forth two times, the camera opens without the user needing to feel around for a button. It's also responsive to the way younger generations are using their phones \u2014 for searches, GPS, texting \u2014 anything but actually calling people. <a href=\"http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Cell-Phone-Texting-2011.aspx\">A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project</a> released in 2011 found that barely 53 percent of Americans preferred a voice call to a text message. So Google has made its voice activation system, Google Now, easy to use with this phone. Unlike the Siri system by Apple, which requires a button to turn it on, Google Now is always listening. All you have to do is say \"OK, Google Now.\" And then it listens for your commands. Google Now combines nicely with GPS so it can help answer questions like, \"Where's the closest Chinese takeout?\" It takes dictation, and it can respond to a text with a quick note, \"Not now! Busy.\" \"It's a refreshing step back,\" says Consumer Reports' Mike Gikas.

As part of a <a href=\"http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2013/Bills/SB515_CD1_.HTM\">larger housing bill</a> in July, the state Legislature approved $100,000 per year for a three-year pilot project that would help get some homeless people off the island and back to their families on the mainland. Participants must leave voluntarily. \"This portion of the bill was designed specifically to help individuals and not to tackle the overall problem of homelessness in the state of Hawaii,\" says <em>Hawaii News Now</em> reporter Chris Tanaka. In addition to wanting to provide help to the homeless, proponents of the legislation say it will save taxpayers money by cutting down on the services the state has to provide, Tanaka tells NPR's Melissa Block. But critics tell Tanaka they're worried the program simply shifts the burden and doesn't actually present a long-term solution. The Department of Human Services, charged with coordinating the logistics, fears it will be a costly administrative burden. One hurdle Tanaka foresees: identification. People living on the street tend to not have any form of ID, so connecting them with their relatives could be a challenge from that standpoint. In addition, the department <a href=\"http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/22916559/return-to-home-program-has-supporters-doubters\">told Hawaii News Now</a> in a statement: \"We remain concerned this program is an invitation to purchase a one-way ticket to Hawaii with a guaranteed return flight home.\" State Rep. John Mizuno, who helped get the program passed, told Tanaka there would be safeguards in place to prevent abuse. He also acknowledged the program \"is not a silver bullet, this does not solve everything.\" There is a precedent for such programs. <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hawaii-to-send-homeless-people-home-2013-7\">Business Insider notes</a> that Hawaii's program \"mirrors <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/nyregion/29oneway.html?_r=2&\">a similar (and equally controversial) plan</a> implemented by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2007.\" And Michael Stoops, director of community organizing for the National Coalition for the Homeless, <a href=\"http://news.msn.com/us/hawaii-offers-homeless-one-way-ticket-off-islands\">tells MSN News</a>: \"These kinds of programs have been used historically to ship homeless people out of town. In the homelessness field it was once called Greyhound therapy. Hawaii now goes a step higher with airplane therapy. Oftentimes, local police departments run such programs offering the stark choices of going to a shelter, jail or hopping on a bus or plane home.\" Pinning down exactly how many people the program would affect is tricky, in part because the number of homeless people in the state is ambiguous. But Tanaka notes that the homeless population in the state \"hasn't grown substantially over the past few years.\" He says the Senate bill references the number of people who used social services in 2011 \u2014 about 14,200 across the state. A 2013 <a href=\"http://humanservices.hawaii.gov/bessd/files/2013/05/2013-Statewide-PIT-Report-5.15.13pdf.pdf\">count of homelessness</a> (pdf) found that about 6,300 people were either sheltered or unsheltered. Then, of course, there's the question of how many people actually have family on the mainland to reunite with. Of those who used homeless services in fiscal year 2012, more than half were either lifelong residents of Hawaii or residents for at least 10 years, according to a state <a href=\"http://uhfamily.hawaii.edu/publications/brochures/HomelessServiceUtilization2012.pdf\">report</a> (pdf); 11 percent who used the services had lived in the state for a year or less. In 2010, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126675999\">NPR took a look</a> at homelessness in Hawaii, and one shelter noted that one-third of the people who stayed there came from out of state. Connie Mitchell, executive director of the Sumner Homeless Men's Shelter in Honolulu, told NPR: \"We are a tourist destination that attracts people who are homeless or people who have resources, and that's something that we really can't control.\" Mizuno told Tanaka he hopes to serve 100 people per year with this pilot program, which Tanaka calls \"highly optimistic.\" It will still be a matter of months before the initiative actually kicks off, given the amount of coordination that's needed. As Tanaka tells NPR, the program is not intended to be the ultimate solution to the issue of homelessness in the state. \"It is crafted out of benevolence, empathy and the desire to help one person at a time,\" he says. \"There are other sections of the bill with far greater appropriations that would probably be far greater in their effectiveness in dealing with homelessness, namely, clean and sober housing, substance abuse treatment and facilities, rental assistance programs.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

They've launched the first multimillion-dollar private equity fund devoted entirely to what they like to call the \"cannabis space.\" It started when Brendan Kennedy was working at the Silicon Valley Bank and learned of an entrepreneur who wanted to sell software for marijuana dispensaries. The idea piqued Kennedy's interest. A few days later, a radio show about legalizing pot piqued it even more. <em>There's an opportunity here, </em>he thought, and picked up the phone and called his Yale business school buddy, Michael Blue. He told Blue he thought his friend needed to quit his job and come start a company in the cannabis industry. \"That's not a call you really ever expect to get,\" Blue says. But then Blue and Kennedy had been bouncing ideas off each other for years. \"We had always known since business school that we wanted to do something together. And Brendan said, 'Listen, we've talked about a lot of ideas, but I think it's the biggest opportunity we're ever going to see in our lifetimes,' \" Blue says. After more than a year of study, they took the plunge and set up a private equity company that would buy up firms serving the marijuana market. Their company, <a href=\"http://www.privateerholdings.com/\">Privateer Holdings</a>, has just raised $7 million from investors. Privateer is focused on the so-called <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/164981433/legalizing-and-regulating-pot-a-growth-industry\">medical marijuana industry</a> and the tiny \u2014 but potentially huge \u2014 market for legal recreational pot. Kennedy cites public opinion polls showing that a majority of Americans now favor legalization and refers to a recent Fox News poll that showed 85 percent of Americans think doctor-prescribed medical marijuana is OK. \"You can't get 85 percent of Americans to agree on anything, but they agree on that. Cannabis is mainstream, and we just need to create mainstream companies now,\" Kennedy says. Their firm won't touch the weed itself, but the executives still see a market for ancillary goods and services of perhaps $10 billion a year. Kennedy suggests they're less interested in companies producing grow lights than those offering insurance or specialized software \u2014 or perhaps a company making devices to deliver marijuana using steam instead of smoke. \"We're interested in companies that change the conversation,\" Kennedy says. <strong>Sowing The Seeds Of A New Industry</strong> <em>Change the conversation</em>. It's one of their favorite phrases. Kennedy and Blue \u2014 who dress like Wall Street bankers \u2014 are trying to catapult the industry above its <em>High Times</em> and Cheech and Chong image. They admit to having some concerns about potential mental health effects of pot on young adults, but believe legalizing and regulating it will make it easier to keep pot out of the hands of minors. So far, Privateer has made just one acquisition, a company called Leafly. It's a user-driven <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/\">recommendation site</a> for marijuana strains and dispensaries. Cy Scott, one of Leafly's co-founders, says teaming up with Privateer has enabled his company to grow. \"Now we have a dedicated sales team, and we're growing our engineering staff, we're growing our content staff. They just brought a lot of resources to bear that we really didn't have on our own,\" Scott says. Privateer's money adds something else. Wharton professor Ethan Mollick says private equity brings credibility to the business of weed and says scholars of entrepreneurship often consider the question: How does a new industry become legitimate? \"I think you're seeing that process beginning or has already begun but gathering steam in cannabis,\" Mollick says. But Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron warns: Not so fast. Miron is a libertarian who advocates legalizing pot, but he thinks Blue and Kennedy are overstating the size of their potential market. He suggests that until marijuana is legal under federal law, it will be hard for mainstream marijuana businesses to thrive. \"To me, there's still a lot of hurdles that have to be jumped through, and it could be five years, 10 years, 20 years before the federal law actually changes. So my hat's off to them, but I don't think I would invest with them at this point,\" Miron says. But others are investing, and Privateer says it will soon be in a position to raise a lot more money for its marijuana-related investment fund.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

Wages and prices kept going down \u2014 and so did consumer spending. After all, would you buy something today if you knew it was going to be cheaper tomorrow? But when he came to power last December, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he could fix the problem, after two \"<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/12/21/167815140/japans-economic-woes-offer-lessons-to-u-s\">lost decades</a>.\" His mix of economic policies was soon dubbed \"Abenomics.\" The government says they have begun to revive the country, while economists say the results have been mixed. Kozo Yamamoto, a lawmaker with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, organized a series of study sessions where \"reflationists,\" including himself, persuaded Abe to use monetary policy aggressively. \"The most important thing is to change the people's expectation on the inflation rate,\" Yamamoto says. \"Many Japanese had deflationary expectations. Then nobody consumes and nobody invests, because in the future, prices will go down.\" Japan has pumped nearly $1.5 trillion into the economy by printing more money and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/04/11/176911237/japans-big-stimulus-move-shocks-globes-market-watchers\">buying back government bonds</a> \u2014 an attempt to create inflation, which is what Abe officials say the country needs. And it has increased public spending by $100 billion, which will be used to improve Japan's infrastructure and for public works projects. The policy has driven up the stock market, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/01/26/170324246/japans-economic-plan-feared-to-be-bad-news-for-everyone-else\">thanks to a weaker Japanese currency, exports are up as well</a>. The government says inflation is now at its highest level in nearly five years, and the economy grew at an annual rate of about 3 percent between April and June. But many Tokyoites say Abe's policies have not yet affected them, and they're still waiting to see which way the economy goes before they make any big purchases or investments. \"I don't feel that the economy is really picking up, at least not for me, personally,\" says Daisuke Okada, a canned coffee salesman, as he takes his lunch break in Tokyo's Shinbashi district. \"But I do get the sense that some companies and consumers now have a more positive outlook on the economy, and they're acting on it more than before,\" he adds. What would affect him, Daisuke says, is if the government raises taxes to offset its massive debt. Up in Tokyo's working-class Kameido neighborhood, Abenomics seem to be having even less impact. \"We sell daily necessities here. I think probably we'd be the last people to ever benefit from Abenomics,\" says local supermarket owner Tatsuhiro Mizuno. Mizuno takes great pride in offering his customers the lowest prices he can, considerably lower than in central Tokyo. A hand-lettered sign in his office sums up his philosophy: \"Conserve everything.\" Mizuno says he hasn't seen any rise in people's wages or any change in their spending habits. Some imported foods are now more expensive. But he refuses to pass the extra cost on to his customers. \"Our customers are very price conscious,\" he says. \"Even a few yen's difference matters to them. I'm sure they'd be uncomfortable paying more. So actually, we cover the price rise for them.\" Some economists note that fuel and food prices are the only ones going up. All other prices are still declining, suggesting that domestic demand is still weak. Noriko Hama, an economist at Doshisha University in Kyoto, argues that much of Japan's stimulus money has gone into creating a stock market bubble, much like that of the late 1980s, while ordinary consumer prices continue to fall. \"I would rename it 'absolutely bad economics,' \" she says dryly. \"I think it is just a ploy to create a bubble economy, in the hope, I suppose, that people will forget the deflationary reality that is pressuring them.\" Hama says Abe's policies \u2014 which she characterizes as supply-side neoconservatism \u2014 are designed to preserve the collusion between government and \"Japan Inc.\" that has been a hallmark of the Liberal Democratic Party's rule for decades. \"It's very much Rip van Winkle economics,\" Hama says, \"dreaming about the days of strong exports, supported by a cheap yen; economic growth being sustained by public works spending, government picking winners and losers among industries.\" She also notes that Abe has promised deregulation that will make it easier for companies to fire workers, or turn them into temporary workers, who now account for 38 percent of the labor force. They often do the same work as full-time workers, but without equal pay and benefits. Some prominent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/opinion/krugman-japan-the-model.html\">foreign</a> <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/shinzo-abe-and-soaring-confidence-in-japan-by-joseph-e--stiglitz\">economists</a> have hailed Abenomics as a model for developed economies to follow. But Hama says that Abenomics threaten to make a very few people wealthy, while leaving most ordinary Japanese behind, and she says that's not something worth emulating.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

Gersine Bullock-Prado \u2014 a Vermont-based pastry chef and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/1617690139\" target=\"_blank\">Bake It Like You Mean It</a> \u2014 has a special place in her heart for them. \"They're not like your normal plum. They're not round. They're oval and very dark purple, almost black.\" When barely ripe, the plums are firm, tart and olive green, Bullock-Prado says. \"[They're] just these lovely little orbs of joy.\" The fruit is the key ingredient in one of her favorite desserts: Zwetschgendatschi (pronounced ts-vetch-kin-dah-chee), which is the Bavarian word for plum cake. She shared the recipe for <em>All Things Considered</em>'s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/175306271/found-recipes\" target=\"_blank\">Found Recipes</a> series. In additional to being delicious, it's also beautiful. Bullock-Prado says it \"looks like a flower in full bloom.\" The cake is traditionally made on a sheet pan and as it bakes, the plum skins start to run red and dye the dough underneath a ruby red color. She says the dessert takes her back to her childhood. \"I grew up half German and half, I call it, 'Alabamonian' \u2014 my father's from Birmingham, Ala.,\" she says. \"My mother [Helga] was an opera singer and met my father in Germany while he was stationed there.\" She says they always had Zwetschgendatschi in the summer no matter where they were \u2014 Germany or Arlington, Va. Every time they had the cake, it felt like a special occasion. \"These plums were so in the season for only about a week or two,\" she says. \"And when we could find them in the States at the time, it was just a joy and a rarity.\" Bullock-Prado ended up opening a pastry shop years later. One day, a man came in and requested a cake he'd had in Germany around World War II. After a few questions, she discovered he was talking about the Zwetschgendatschi. He asked if she could bake him one. Although she said yes, she knew it wasn't going to be easy. \"It wasn't tough because it's a tough thing to make \u2014 the tough part was that I hadn't made it since my mom died,\" she says. \"So I was sitting there thinking, 'I don't want to do this because it'll bring back so many memories and I'm going to break down in the kitchen and I'll just look silly to my employees.' \" But Bullock-Prado steeled herself, and when the plums were in season, she set to work. Pressing out the dough and putting it the oven proceeded without incident. But when she opened oven door 40 minutes later, she lost it. \"That smell came to me \u2014 and it was my mother, my mother was in the room, and I started to weep. I mean that smell that comes from that cake, it's different from any plum cake or apricot cake; it is so specific,\" she says. \"And since it was my mother's joy to make in the summertime, it was Helga coming from the oven.\" When her employees came into the kitchen to see what was going on, they assumed something must have exploded in the oven, \"that'd I'd done something horribly wrong,\" she says. \"But ... I'd done something incredibly right,\" she says. \"It was just sad and fantastic all at the same time.\" <hr /> <h3>Recipe: Zwetschgendatschi</h3> <em>Bullock-Prado used traditional plums in the version pictured here because the Damson variety weren't quite in season.</em> <em>Makes one 8-inch tart</em> <strong>Crust</strong> 1 cup all purpose flour 1/2 cup cornstarch 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup unsalted butter, very cold, cut into small pieces 1 egg yolk 1 1/2 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <strong>Filling</strong> 3 pounds Damson/Italian prune plums <strong>To Finish:</strong> 1 tablespoon raw sugar (or 1 packet you've pilfered from Starbucks) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. For the crust, using the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, pulse together the flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, sweetened condensed milk and vanilla. Slowly add the egg yolk mixture to the flour mixture while pulsing; continue until the dough just begins to come together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently knead it until the dry ingredients are fully integrated and the dough holds together, being careful not to overwork it. Press the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Spray an 8-inch fluted tart pan with nonstick cooking spray. Crumble the majority of the dough into the tart pan and gently press onto the bottom and up the sides so that you have at least 1/8 inch of crust all around. If you have extra dough left over once you've completely covered the tart pan, set it aside. For the filling, split each plum along the natural seam and remove the stone, leaving the plum still hinged on the backside like a little book. Cut a 1/4-inch notch at the top of the plum, where the stem once was. Why? Because that's how my mother and Omi did it. Arrange the plums upright on the uncooked dough, flesh side facing in. If you have any leftover tart dough, crumble it evenly on top of the plums. Sprinkle the raw sugar over the plums as well. Bake the tart until the sides of the dough are golden brown and the plums are tender, about 45 minutes. If the plums begin to brown before they are tender, carefully cover them with aluminum foil and continue baking until the juices of the plums start running.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

Traditionally, when worshippers come to the <em>gurdwara</em>, they wash their hands, have snacks, and then sit down and listen to the service, says Dr. Kulwant Dhaliwal, the current temple president. He's urging members of this congregation to keep their spirits up as the shooting anniversary approaches. \"The community has been gradually sort of healing and settling down,\" he says. \"Of course the families who lost their loved ones will never probably lead the [same] life. .... Their lives changed forever.\" This weekend, the temple will hold a series of events to honor the victims, including a continuous recitation of the Sikh holy book, cover to cover. It's a ritual that happens at both happy and sad events, and is intended to bring peace and solace. Sikhism began in the 15th century in the Punjab region in South Asia. Its basic tenets are equality, living by honest means and helping the needy. But since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, some Sikhs in the United States have been harassed or attacked by people wrongly assuming they're Muslim extremists. A security guard now sits just inside the temple's front entrance \u2014 a constant reminder of the violence that erupted there last summer. Nirmal Singh says she still gets nervous when she walks in from the parking lot, and her kids still have questions. \"Especially my youngest daughter, she's 6 years old. She'll be like, 'Why this has to happen?' And I say, 'You know what? We live in a world where anything could happen, not only shootings, but anything,' Singh says. \"So that's what I tell them. I say, 'Just be safe.' \" While some worshippers remain fearful of violence, others seem even more determined to confront prejudice against their faith, like Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka. He looks down at a string of orange prayer beads around his wrist, as he sings a traditional Sikh prayer. \"So it's a very simple mantra,\" he says, \"and really the basis is that if you can even just say God's name, or keep God in your mind, that will help you become one with God.\" The prayer is one Kaleka's uncle used to sing at the end of Sunday services. His uncle was <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/08/06/158192299/at-sikh-temple-leader-attacked-gunman-died-trying-to-protect-others\">Satwant Singh Kaleka</a>, the temple president who was killed while trying to fend off the gunman. Today, Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka works at the Medical College of Wisconsin, where he just earned a Ph.D. in Alzheimer's disease research. The 30-year-old Kaleka started wearing the prayer beads after the temple shooting last year. He also let his beard and hair grow long, and now wears a turban in his daily life, as do most observant Sikh men. \"People who died in that shooting looked different,\" Kaleka says, \"and I found this as a valuable opportunity to show the world that no matter how different anybody looks, that we're just as much of a human being. And in America, we're just as American as anyone else.\" While much of the reaction to his long beard and turban has been positive, Kaleka says some still look on with fear, especially at airports. \"I got to the gate, and there was this young kid,\" Kaleka says, \"and he just looks at me in absolute terror. He says, 'Don't kill me, don't kill me!' \" That was actually a great moment, Kaleka says, because he was able to explain who he was and assure the family they had nothing to worry about. \"By the time our plane landed, like, me and that kid were high-fiving and hugging,\" Kaleka says, \"and that's sort of the notion that for me, is what it's all about.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 Milwaukee Public Radio.

Bishop is the editorial director of the show, and Lancaster is the lead instructor of its cooking school. They've both contributed to the new <em>America's Test Kitchen DIY Cookbook</em>. They join <em>Fresh Air</em>'s Terry Gross to talk about preparing summer foods, and to answer some cooking questions from the <em>Fresh Air</em> staff. <hr /> <h3><strong>Interview Highlights</strong></h3> <strong>On grilling the perfect burger</strong> Bishop: \"I think that if you're going to be grilling the hamburger, one of the reasons you want to be grilling it is to get that great crust on the outside, and in order to give the grill enough time to put a crust on it, it's going to have to be a fairly thick patty. If you're starting with a really thin patty, it's going to be overcooked by the time it gets well-browned on the outside, so make it fairly thick. ... I would say 3/4 [of an] inch to an inch is about right. ... \"You're going to put a divot through the center ... because what happens is when the burger is on the grill, the muscle fibers shrink, and what is a flat patty turns into a tennis ball. You get this ... round burger that then is very difficult to put toppings on or put on a bun. So the way to prevent that is to anticipate the rounding and to put a divot in the top of it, so that means simply going around and pressing a half inch depression in the sort of center half of the top of the burger, and that will naturally puff up on the grill.\" <strong>On massaging raw kale in order to soften it</strong> Bishop: \"You are basically putting the kale in the bowl, and with your hands just rubbing it. I guess what you're doing ... is you're breaking down the cellular structure very gently. You're not trying to mash it or mangle it, but you're making the leaves a little bit more tender. The outside of the leaves can be a little rough, and I think you're basically using your hands as emery boards. You're exfoliating with kale, so it seems a little bit more tender when you go to use it in a salad.\" Lancaster: \"And it definitely preserves its fresh flavor, so you're not cooking the kale in order to soften it.\" <strong>How to grill and marinate tofu</strong> Bishop: \"It's a sponge. Tofu is a lot like eggplant, and that's a good thing in the sense that it's a blank canvas that will soak up whatever flavors you want to give it. Unlike meat, where marinating can take a fair amount of time, tofu \u2014 20 minutes is going to be enough. So basically, marinate it as long as it takes you to get the grill going. The best way to do it \u2014 don't bother trying to cut it into cubes, skewer it. ... Take extra-firm tofu, don't try to do the soft tofu. Cut it cross-wise into eight slabs. ... You're basically cutting it into little rectangular cutlets. ... Put them in a baking dish, [using] any marinade you like. I think soy always makes sense with tofu \u2014 the salt makes most things taste better. Add something a little bit sweet, maybe a little hoisin or oyster sauce; add a little oil, a little vegetable so that it won't stick. You can add some spices \u2014 five-spice powder, chipotle chilies. You want to use the strong flavors with the tofu because the reverse of it being a blank canvas is that it can be very boring, and so if you don't use strong flavors in the marinade it will be a little bit boring. This is a good time to use [an] oiled paper towel to oil down that grill grate. ... Grill them just until they're lightly charred on each side, and it's a really great way to make a quick vegan summer grill entr\u00e9e.\" <strong>On grilling peaches</strong> Bishop: \"Halve and pit them, brush them lightly with oil, and I think grilled peaches and pork is a natural combination. The only trick is you want to get ripe but still firm peaches. If it's a peach that's so ripe that it's going to run down your chin and neck as you're eating it, you're going to have a little trouble with it, probably, on the grill. You don't want to use the rock-hard, awful-tasting peaches, but you want to catch it right before it's soft, but when it's ripe.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

Michelle Knight stood just feet away from Ariel Castro in a Cleveland courtroom, the first time she&#8217;s been seen publicly since her rescue from the house where she was held captive. &#8220;You took 11 years of my life away and I have got it back,&#8221; she told Castro. &#8220;I spent 11 years in hell. Now you&#8217;re hell is just beginning. I will overcome all this has happened, but you will face hell for eternity.&#8221; Knight, 32, did not face Castro as she spoke, but he glance toward her several times after she entered the courtroom. She was the first woman abducted Castro in 2002 after he lured her into his house with the promise of a puppy for her son. Castro later made a rambling statement in which he blamed his sex addiction, his former wife and even the FBI for not thoroughly investigating the abductions. He apologized to his victims but also claimed most of the sex was consensual. &#8220;These people are trying to paint me as a monster,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a monster. I&#8217;m sick.&#8221; He also claimed the women lived a happy life with him. &#8220;We had a lot of harmony that went on in that home,&#8221; he said. Knight was the first woman abducted Castro in 2002 after he lured her into his house with the promise of a puppy for her son. Castro has pleaded guilty to charges that he repeatedly raped Knight and two other victims, and also forced Knight to miscarry after he impregnated her. Prosecutors detailed Ariel Castro&#8217;s assaults and law enforcement witnesses described the jury-rigged prison he built in his ramshackle home. With the possibility of the death penalty for a forced miscarriage taken off the table, Castro stands to get life in prison plus 1,000 years. FBI agent Andrew Burke said Castro turned his house into a prison by creating a makeshift alarm system and chaining them inside bolted bedrooms. Bedroom windows were boarded shut from the inside with heavy closet doors and doorknobs had been removed and replaced with multiple locks, he said. The house was divided in ways to make it more secure and to hide the existence of rooms, he said. Burke also testified that Castro would occasionally pay his victims after raping them. But he then would require them to pay him if they wanted something special from the store. The letter written by Castro was found in his home and shown in court. It read &#8220;Confession and Details&#8221; at the top. Cuyahoga County Sheriff&#8217;s Detective Dave Jacobs said he talked with Castro a few days after the women escaped and that Castro said, &#8220;I knew what I did was wrong.&#8221; Early in the hearing, Castro tried to apologize to the victims, but after speaking with the judge said he would do that later in the proceeding. A police officer who helped rescue the women said one was reluctant to come out of her room even when she saw the officers. They were scared even after they were taken out of the house and quickly began sharing details about the horrors they went through, saying that they had been starved and beaten. &#8220;They were just shouting out a lot of things,&#8221; said Cleveland police officer Barb Johnson. She described the women as thin, pale and scared. Responding to questions from prosecutors, Cleveland police detective Andrew Harasimchuk said that the women all described a pattern of being physically, sexually and emotionally assaulted for years. He said all three women were abducted after Castro offered them a ride and that each was chained in his basement and sexually assaulted within a few hours of being kidnapped. Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty said in a sentencing memorandum filed Wednesday that Castro, who fed his captives only one meal a day, &#8220;admits his disgusting and inhuman conduct&#8221; but &#8220;remains remorseless for his actions.&#8221; The memorandum described a diary kept by one of the women. &#8220;The entries speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a prisoner of war &#8230; of being treated like an animal,&#8221; it says. The sentencing could take up to four hours, court officials said, with Castro, his attorneys, his victims and prosecution witnesses getting a chance to speak. The legal team representing the women&#8217;s interests declined to comment on whether they would testify or send statements to the court. Prosecutors used a model of the house where Castro, 53, imprisoned the women to present their case. They also showed photos taken from inside the disheveled home. The women quickly escaped after Amanda Berry kicked out the door panel on May 6 and Castro was arrested within hours. The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years old. Some horrific details of the women&#8217;s ordeal had already emerged, including tales of being chained to poles in the basement or a bedroom heater or inside a van, with one woman forced to wear a motorcycle helmet while chained in the basement and, after she tried to escape, having a vacuum cord wrapped around her neck. Castro repeatedly starved and beat one of the victims each time she was pregnant, forcing her to miscarry five times. He forced the same woman on threat of death to safely deliver the child he fathered with another victim on Christmas Day 2006. The same day, prosecutors say, Castro raped the woman who helped deliver his daughter. As part of his plea deal, Castro was to receive a sentence of life with no chance of parole for aggravated murder in the forced miscarriage. He would then receive 1,000 years for the kidnapping, rape, assault and other charges. Berry, 27, made a surprise onstage appearance at a rap concert last weekend, and a second victim, Gina DeJesus, 23, has made a few televised comments. Knight, 32, appeared with Berry and DeJesus in a video in early July thanking the community for its support. Knight, the first of three to disappear, also sent police a handwritten letter thanking them for their help collecting cards and gifts for the women. In the note, Knight told Second District Cmdr. Keith Sulzer, &#8220;Life is tough, but I&#8217;m tougher!&#8221;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 WBUR-FM.

City To Use Eminent Domain To Stem Foreclosures"}, "text": "The city of Richmond, California, has plans to become the first city in the country to use eminent domain to stop home foreclosures. Eminent domain is typically used to force homeowners to sell their property to make way for a new sports stadium or highway, for example. But earlier this week, Richmond announced it had sent letters to banks and mortgage holders, threatening to use eminent domain to seize more than 600 underwater mortgages if lenders don&#8217;t agree to sell them the loans by mid-August. The idea comes from the San Francisco-based private equity firm <a href=\"http://mortgageresolution.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mortgage Resolution Partners</a>, which is helping Richmond. The firm is also working with cities and towns across the country that are considering this approach. Wall Street banks strongly oppose the plan, threatening lawsuits if it goes through. Critics in the banking industry argue that using eminent domain in this way could hurt the housing market. <ul><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/02/15/eminent-domain-mortgages\">A Radical Idea To Keep Homeowners In Their Homes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2012/07/12/eminent-domain-homeowners\">Calif.

From equal education for women and minorities, to the differences in funding between wealthy and poor communities, efforts to provide quality public education and reduce these differences have proved to be difficult to attain, not to mention controversial and divisive. The Obama administration has pushed for education reform with U.S. Secretary of Education <strong>Arne Duncan</strong> at the helm. Duncan&#8217;s policies have appealed to both Republicans and Democrats, but his task is far from easy. <div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">&#8220;One generation ago we were first in college completion rates, and today we are twelfth, and we have had many countries pass us by.&#8221;</div> The United States\u2019 education attainment, when compared to the world, does not paint a good picture. The Council on Foreign Relations <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/united-states/remedial-education-federal-education-policy/p30141?cid=otr-marketing_use-remedialeducation&cid=nlc-news_release-news_release-link2-20130617&sp_mid=41824468&sp_rid=\" target=\"_blank\">finds that the U.S. has slipped 10 spots</a> in both high school and college graduation rates in the past three decades, and the Economist\u2019s Intelligence Unit <a href=\"http://thelearningcurve.pearson.com/index/index-ranking\" target=\"_blank\">ranks the United States 17th</a> out of 50. \u201cOne generation ago we were first in college completion rates, and today we are 12th, and we have had many countries pass us by,\u201d Duncan told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now</a></em>. \u201cObviously in a world that\u2019s shrinking and getting flatter, and with a globally competitive economy, jobs are going to go &#8212; high-wage, high-skill jobs, good middle-class jobs &#8212; are going to go to where the knowledge workers are. And I desperately want that to be in the United States. And so we have to stop being so complacent, we have to get better faster, and I would argue we have to get better at every level on the education continuum, from cradle to career.\u201d Secretary Duncan defends the Obama administrations\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/race-to-the-top\" target=\"_blank\">Race to the Top</a> program, which ties federal funding to improving school performance. \u201cThere was this huge, unmet need for reform,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cAnd what we frankly did is create the opportunity &#8212; we helped to create the space and unleash that. And at the end of the day, the fascinating lesson, to me, it wasn\u2019t about the money. It was really about an opportunity to move the country and to move school districts and states in the direction they knew they needed to do, but sort of quite hadn\u2019t felt the space or the opportunity or the permission, previously.\u201d Duncan says Race to the Top has promoted creativity and innovation among school districts to better serve their students, where President George W. Bush&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/no-child-left-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">No Child Left Behind Act</a> placed an emphasis on test scores. \u201cI\u2019m not one who thinks we should not evaluate kids ever &#8230; you also don\u2019t want to over-test,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cBut what I\u2019m interested in looking, is how much students are improving each year, looking at their growth and gain.&#8221; <div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">&#8220;A significant investment in expanding access to high quality early childhood education is the best investment our country can make.&#8221;</div> Under No Child Left Behind, the focus was only on the student&#8217;s final score, Duncan said. \u201cBut if a child comes to you, and the child\u2019s a couple grade levels behind and they leave you at grade level or a little bit below grade level you\u2019ve actually done a terrific job. You\u2019re a heroic teacher,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder No Child Left Behind, that teacher or that school or district would actually be labeled a failure.\u201d Duncan says that his two main goals as secretary are providing greater access to early childhood education and creating incentives to recruit the best teachers. \u201cA significant investment in expanding access to high quality early childhood education is the best investment our country can make,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cFor every dollar we invest, we as a society get back seven dollars.\u201d Duncan also wants to make supporting great teachers and attracting great teachers a top priority by increasing teacher pay and paying teachers more for taking on difficult assignments. \u201cWe, as a country, are not going to get where we need to go if we don\u2019t do a much better job of supporting teachers,\u201d Duncan said. <h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/news/staff/bios/duncan.html\" target=\"_blank\">Arne Duncan</a></strong>, U.S. secretary of education.

After he received the asylum documents from his lawyer this morning, Snowden reportedly took a cab alone as he left the Moscow airport for the first time in a month. He&#8217;d been stranded there since June 23, when the U.S. revoked his passport. His departure from the airport comes one day after The Guardian newspaper published more of his leaks. The U.S. has demanded that Russia turn over Snowden for prosecution, but Russia has refused.

But, as reported in a recent Bloomberg series (<a href=\"#more\">article list below</a>), the Hebrew Home is different. The nursing facility actively encourages and supports sex and intimacy among its residents &#8212; including those with dementia. But the original report in Bloomberg News also told heart breaking stories about a nursing home in Iowa, where an elderly couple with dementia had sex, and ultimately staffers were fired, the couple was pulled apart and one family sued, calling it rape. <div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">They do not give up a civil right simply because they are in need of nursing care in a facility.<div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash;Daniel Reingold</div></div> With an issue so fraught with painful possibilities, is the Hebrew Home doing the right thing? \u201cVery few nursing homes around the country acknowledged the sexual behavior or intimacy of their residents,\u201d <strong>Daniel Reingold</strong>, president and CEO of the Hebrew Home, told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now</a></em>. \u201cWe realized that there needed to be a grown-up conversation and a grown-up policies and procedures to govern this behavior.\u201d Reingold says the nursing home&#8217;s policy and procedures provide a non-judgmental, safe and effective strategy to support adults\u2019 well-being. \u201cOur position is very strongly that consenting adults who have capacity, this is a civil right of theirs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not give up a civil right simply because they are in need of nursing care in a facility. And that our obligation as a nursing facility is to encourage their civil rights, as we would do with respect to voting.\u201d However, the question of consent becomes problematic when patients have dementia, and families can become deeply upset if their parent or partner is intimate with someone else. Reingold says that just because someone has dementia, it does not mean they are incapable of making a choice in a given moment. He acknowledges however, that it isn\u2019t a simple issue, and \u201cconsent is a difficult and mercurial thing.\u201d But a policy regarding sexual expression, which involves residents, caretakers and families, creates the conditions to avoid or minimize unwanted sexual contact or unwanted intimacy. The Hebrew Home has had several residents who have become romantically involved, and those relationship have generally been good for the residents and acceptable to the families, Reingold said. One resident, who Reingold calls \u201cPhil,\u201d became involved with another man, \u201cHarold,\u201d at the facility. But Phil was still married to his wife. \u201cThese gentlemen found comfort with each other, and we had the job of discussing it with the wife,\u201d Reingold said. \u201cAnd once she realized how happy Phil was with Harold, she began to appreciate that it was giving him pleasure at the end of his life. And she began to become accepting of it.\u201d Reingold says that growing old is a process of loss: losing your friends, losing your spouse, losing your mobility, losing your memory. But the sense of touch is the last to go. \u201cSome research shows that the sense of touch never goes, even if a person is in a coma,\u201d Reingold said. \u201cAnd so why would we not want to encourage the pleasure of intimacy?\u201d <ul><li><a href=\"http://www.hebrewhome.org/uploads/ckeditor/files/trailer_sepg.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Sexual rights policy at Hebrew Home</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.hebrewhome.org/welcome.asp\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Daniel Reingold</strong></a>, president and CEO of the Hebrew Home. <a name=\"more\"></a></li></ul><h4>Read more via Bloomberg</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-22/boomer-sex-with-dementia-foreshadowed-in-nursing-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Boomer Sex With Dementia Foreshadowed in Nursing Home</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-23/sex-in-geriatrics-sets-hebrew-home-apart-in-elderly-care.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sex in Geriatrics Sets Hebrew Home Apart in Elderly Care</a></li><li><strong>Infographic:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/infographics/2013-07-22/lets-talk-about-sex-in-nursing-homes.html\" target=\"_blank\">Let&#8217;s Talk About Sex &#8230; In Nursing Homes</a></li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 WBUR-FM.

The outbreak of the rare parasite cyclospora has been reported in at least 15 states, and federal officials warned Wednesday it was too early to say that the threat was over. But if you&#8217;re looking to find out exactly where it came from, you may be out of luck. Health officials in Nebraska and Iowa say they&#8217;ve traced cases there to prepackaged salad, but they haven&#8217;t said which brand or where it was sold, explaining only that most if not all of it wasn&#8217;t grown locally. The lack of information has fueled concern from consumers and others who argue that companies should be held accountable when outbreaks happen and that customers need the information about where outbreaks originated to make smart food choices. &#8220;If you want the free market to work properly, then you need to let people have the information they need to make informed decisions,&#8221; said Bill Marler, a Seattle attorney who specializes in class-action food-safety lawsuits. Heath officials in California, which provides much of the nation&#8217;s leafy green produce, said Wednesday that the state hadn&#8217;t received any reports of cyclospora cases. &#8220;Based on the most currently available information, the leafy greens being implicated in this outbreak were not grown or processed in California,&#8221; Corey Egel, a California Department of Public Health spokesman, said in a statement to The Associated Press. Mark Hutson, who owns a Save-Mart grocery store in Lincoln, Neb., said the lack of specific brand information threatened to hurt all providers, including the good actors. &#8220;I think there was so little information as to what was causing the problem, that people just weren&#8217;t sure what to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Frankly, we would prefer to have the names out there.&#8221; Authorities said they still hadn&#8217;t determined whether the cases of cyclospora in the different states are connected. &#8220;It&#8217;s too early to say for sure whether it&#8217;s over, and thus too early to say there&#8217;s no risk of still getting sick,&#8221; said Mar\u00eda-Bel\u00e9n Moran, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only Iowa and Nebraska officials have directly linked the outbreak in their states to a salad mix of iceberg and romaine lettuce, carrots and red cabbage. But consumers far from known outbreak areas have acknowledged it was a factor as they shopped for produce. <h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Karen Brooks</strong>, <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-31/lifestyle/sns-rt-us-usa-infection-cyclospora-20130725_1_salad-mix-stomach-bug-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">has been covering</a> the cyclospora outbreak for Reuters.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 WBUR-FM.

The fund is a collection of stocks in publicly traded companies that have one thing in common: the city they call home. When people buy into the <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleetf.com/\">Nashville Area Exchange Traded Fund</a> \u2014 which starts trading at $25 a share \u2014 they will essentially be placing a bet based on an area code. \"So everyone will have a way to invest in our companies that is unlike that of any other city in the country,\" said Beth Courtney when she announced the creation of this investment fund on a riverbank with Nashville's modest skyline behind her. \"Own this town,\" the fund's promotional materials proclaim. Courtney and her business partners are trying to make money through the venture, which charges fees for managing the portfolio. But Mike Shmerling, chairman of LocalShares Inc., also sees an opportunity for folks to invest in the companies they know instead of the giant mutual funds full of firms they don't know much about. \"They have a relative that has been to an HCA hospital; they eat at Cracker Barrel; they shop at Dollar General; or they go to church with somebody from Tractor Supply,\" Shmerling says. The plan, if it works, is to expand this concept to other cities. The team has formed a company called LocalShares, and co-founder Bill Decker says it operates on the assumption that some places are just more business friendly. \"We think we can show there's something about those local economic ecosystems that seems to be especially supportive of companies that are headquartered there,\" Decker says. Nashville, as a city, is a place that at least has a buzz at the moment. It's attracting droves of young people, like Angie Nicolletta who came for a job opportunity. \"Nashville is like a new up and coming, booming city from everything that I've seen,\" Nicolletta says. Nicolletta is on her usual visit to a dog park that overlooks the city's commercial center. She and others say owning a piece of Nashville sounds fun, even just for the novelty of it. Mark Hill works in real estate and also dabbles in trading stocks. He says putting money in just one place goes against what he's learned about investing. \"It's a geographical limitation that could really bite you pretty good if you didn't watch out,\" Hill says. There have been a few attempts at exchange-traded funds focused in single states: Oklahoma and Texas. Both folded because there weren't enough buyers. Experts are dubious about an even more restricted fund. One calls it \"the most absurd product to hit the market.\" Eric Dutram of Zacks Investment Research in Chicago is more diplomatic. \"I've never been to Nashville. I've heard good things, but it seems an odd place to start,\" Dutram says. Why not a city with many more corporate headquarters in a more diverse set of industries, he asks. The Nashville fund has just two dozen companies, and half of them are related to health care. The optimists seem to be people who do business in Nashville. They include the city's mayor, Karl Dean, who has been drumming up investors. \"I am just bullish on Nashville, and I think everybody ought to be,\" Dean says. The city's business-friendly image will get a true market test as the fund tries to survive on the stock exchange.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 Nashville Public Radio.

People like \"the astonishing ant man.\" That's what his students call Jack Longino. Longino started out collecting stamps in his childhood, but that got boring fast. Man-made things just didn't thrill, so Longino decided to \"get small.\" As in: \"If you're shopping for a home entertainment system,\" he says, \"you can't do better than a good dissecting microscope.\" In school, Longino put insects under the microscope, and voila! A new world emerged. \"With insects, I kept finding things I could never have imagined,\" he said. Like amazing jaws: \"These strange sideways mandibles with all the teeth on them,\" he says, with wonder still in his now grown-up voice, \"and these shield-like faces.\" They're scary, he says, \"and they made me think of Hollywood monsters, the creature in <em>Alien</em> and <em>Predator</em>.\" When he grew up, Longino started hunting these monsters on his hands and knees in Central American rain forests. He found that the hardest part was just getting there. \"You know, when the truck is starting to slide backwards in the mud towards the cliff edge, those are scary moments,\" he recalls. Once there, he did what entomologists do: whack the leaf litter on the ground with a machete, then shake it through mesh screens into bags. Scientists call it, not surprisingly, \"sifting.\" You end up with bags of what looks like potting soil. \"You don't see much when you look at it,\" Longino says of the so-called \"Winkler bags,\" \"but actually when you look close, there's a high concentration of little crawling things, and that's the gold.\" The ants eventually escape out the bottom and into a container full of alcohol. \"It is hard work,\" Longino assures, \"but you do have the sitting-around-drinking-beer phase.\" But that's a brief phase if you want to discover new species, and Longino is pretty good at that. He's just published two papers describing 33 new species of ants, bringing his personal \"new species\" total to 131. Longino says that's actually average among entomologists. \"I do OK,\" he says, noting that some scientists have discovered thousands. But naming the newly discovered bugs is where you can really have fun.

And several states are offering <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/blog/monday-map-sales-tax-holidays-2013\">tax-free shopping</a> to encourage purchases. But most economists say this year's sales will be slower than last summer's because consumers have been coping with more expensive gasoline and higher payroll taxes. \"This year's back-to-school shopping season appears slightly weaker than last year,\" economist Chris Christopher, with IHS Global Insight, said of the retail period that ranks second only to the holiday shopping season. To get consumers in the mood to shop, many retailers started back-to-school advertising and sale pricing weeks ago. The data aren't in yet to show the final impact of those early promotions on July sales. But traditionally, August is the key month for sales of kids' backpacks, shoes, clothes, lunchboxes and notebooks. Those sales are <a href=\"http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&op=viewlive&sp_id=1626\">expected to total $635</a> for the average family with school-age children, down from last year's $689, according to the National Retail Federation. Spending is higher for college-bound students, who need more expensive things like computers and textbooks, as well as bedding and beanbag chairs for dorm rooms. This year, the average family with a child in college will spend $837, down from last year's $907, the trade association estimates. The NRF says school and college shopping combined will add up to $72.5 billion. <strong>Looking To Cut Corners</strong> \"As they continue to grapple with the impact of increased payroll taxes, Americans will look to cut corners where they can, but will buy what their kids need,\" NRF President Matthew Shay said in a statement on the season's outlook. Examples of corner-cutting include shopping for generic rather than brand-name goods, he said. Roughly 1 in 3 shoppers said in a recent NRF survey that he would do that, as well as wait for sales. And more people will be heading to discount stores, according to the New York-based International Council of Shopping Centers. <a href=\"http://www.icsc.org/press/u.s.-consumers-expect-to-spend-about-285-on-back-to-school-items\">A survey</a> done in mid-July by that group showed 9 in 10 consumers plan to shop in discount stores this year, up from 83 percent in 2012. To give shoppers yet another way to reduce the hit to their pocketbooks, 18 states are offering sales tax holidays this summer. Typically, the state will name a weekend in August when consumers can buy clothes, shoes and classroom supplies without paying sales tax. The states place dollar limits on the amount they exempt from taxes. The caps vary from state to state, but most run around $100 per item. The idea of offering a sales tax holiday began in New York in the late 1990s and then spread to other states. <strong>Tax Holidays</strong> The tax break is popular with shoppers, especially where sales taxes are high. In Houston, for example, state and local sales taxes total 8.25 percent. So a family spending, say, $600 on back-to-school shopping for the kids can save $49.50 in sales taxes. And the tax break is well liked by bricks-and-mortar retailers, who say it provides them with the one opportunity each year to compete on a level field with the online retailers who don't collect sales taxes. On Wednesday, Massachusetts lawmakers renewed that state's annual tax break, making it effective Aug. 10-11. House Speaker Robert DeLeo said in a statement that \"the sales tax holiday will provide relief to consumers and encourage residents to shop locally.\" Ed Wulfe, a Houston real estate developer who specializes in building retail stores, says brick-and-mortar retailers appreciate any help in getting shoppers walking through stores instead of hunkering down at home. \"If the customer traffic is in the stores, they're going to buy, and they're going to buy more than just the back-to-school merchandise,\" he said. <strong>Debating The Tax Break</strong> Still, many economists say the policy makes little sense. For one thing, failure to collect tax revenues reduces the amount of money going into state coffers to help pay for the infrastructure, such as the roads and bridges needed by all businesses. Moreover, it <a href=\"http://itep.org/itep_reports/2013/07/sales-tax-holidays-an-ineffective-alternative-to-real-sales-tax-reform.php#.UflJA6wkxoU\">doesn't target aid</a> to the poorest shoppers, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. \"You're really distorting your tax system,\" said Steven Craig, who teaches public sector economics at the University of Houston. \"The whole purpose of the tax system is to raise money for the government, but to have as small [an] impact on the economy as possible. Is there any reason that we want to help retailers of clothing more than retailers of electronics, just for example? No.\" And of course, not every customer can be drawn into stores by a tax break set for just one specific weekend. Busy parents often have to decide between saving money and saving time. Jessica Vasquez was hitting a Target store in Houston this week with her sons, ages 5 and 7, and a niece, age 10. She said that the state's mid-August tax break would have no impact on her. \"I like to get my shopping done ahead of time,\" she said. <em>Andrew Schneider is a reporter for KUHF in Houston.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 KUHF-FM.

After all, there's something delightfully cheesy about a beach town. \"I guess I'm a cheesy guy. I like this kind of stuff,\" Grabenstein says. \"Ever since I was a kid I loved tourist towns.\" The author points out shop names as we walk along his stretch of the shore. There's the Sunglass Menagerie, an ice cream shop called Do Me A Flavor, Shore Good Donuts and How You Brewin' coffee. I'll spare you the rest \u2014 Long Beach Island has 18 miles of this stuff. At Fred's Beach Haven Diner (not a very exciting name \u2014 Grabenstein calls it Pancake Palace in his books) we take one of the turquoise blue booths by the window and order a local delicacy, the Taylor Pork Roll. (It's a lot like bologna.) <strong>Detective Dudley Do-Right</strong> Grabenstein is a New Yorker who just vacations here in Beach Haven. He says he didn't initially set out to mix work and pleasure: \"I actually came up with the title for the first book before anything else, which is <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/titles/207366041/tilt-a-whirl\">Tilt-a-Whirl</a>, because I'm a Bruce Springsteen nut and his song ['4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)'], where he sings about 'that tilt-a-whirl down on the south beach drag, I got on it [last night] and my shirt got caught' was just in my head and I thought 'tilt-a-whirl' would be a great name for a mystery. And I could do a whole series and each one would be named after an amusement park ride.\" There's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/titles/207389096/mad-mouse-a-john-ceepak-mystery\">Mad Mouse</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/titles/207389832/whack-a-mole\">Whack A Mole</a>, <em>Rolling Thunder</em>. Grabenstein changed the name of this little town to Sea Haven, but he still needed a detective. \"I wanted to do the opposite of all the heroes I loved in other murder mysteries,\" he says. \"You know, the hard-boiled guy, he used to be a cop then his partner got shot. He always has like a bottle in his drawer. So I thought, what if I did the exact opposite and created almost an overgrown Eagle Boy Scout, a Dudley Do-Right, a guy who will not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do.\" The result is Detective John Ceepak, a former Army military police officer who took a cushy job as a beach cop to recover from serving in Iraq. And, well, you can guess that he never quite gets the chance to relax. Ceepak is sitting in this very booth in Fred's Diner \u2014 or, Pancake Palace \u2014 in the first book, when he spots a young woman covered in blood stumbling from the amusement park just up the street. <strong>A Dark Sense Of Humor</strong> Our next stop is Fantasy Island, one of those tiny, blink-and-you-miss amusement parks scattered along Long Beach Island. \"They're terrific,\" Grabenstein says, \"and there's almost every ride. Like that one over there will drop you down like a free fall. Over there we've got a tilt-a-whirl.\" In Grabenstein's <em>Tilt-a-Whirl,</em> that stumbling young woman's father was found slumped in one of the ride's turtle-shaped cars. The author delights in finding innocuous places to shove a body. \"That is always one of the great joys, if you will, of writing a murder mystery, is coming up with an interesting place to drop the body,\" he says. \"I had one take place on a roller coaster in the middle of a ride and that was a lot of fun to think about.\" Grabenstein's mysteries \u2014 all eight of them so far \u2014 have a dark sense of humor. In his most gruesome book, <em>Whack A Mole,</em> a serial killer buries human heads out on the beach just a couple of blocks from here. The body parts are discovered during a sand castle competition, pretty much right below where George and Maddy Fantry are sprawled out on the sand. The Fantrys live across the bay and they only remember one real murder in the past couple of years. \"We've been here a long time,\" Maddy says. \"People are on vacation and everyone's happy when they are on vacation, you know, they leave their attitudes at home,\" George says. Grabenstein plays with that stereotype by punctuating the calm, sleepy setting with the occasional serial killer. He couldn't predict when he started writing that reality would get even crazier. Two disasters were about to hit the shore: Superstorm Sandy and Snooki, one of the cast members of the MTV reality show <em>Jersey</em><em> Shore</em>. The show hit the beach like a tsunami and Grabenstein couldn't ignore it, so he wrote it into his seventh Ceepak mystery, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/titles/207390765/fun-house\">Fun House</a>. He takes me to 1209 Ocean Terrace, the notorious Seaside Heights home of the <em>Jersey Shore</em> gang. This is where they filmed the reality show, and when we arrive we find that even though the show is off the air, people still line up to tour the house. In <em>Fun House,</em> Grabenstein pits Ceepak against a rowdy group of drunks in a similar reality show. (\"They just rub him the wrong way,\" the author says.) The show's producers figure out that the more trouble the cast gets into, the higher the ratings, which is true in real life too. But in the book, the high jinks escalate to murder. <strong>A Different Kind Of 'Carcass'</strong> Grabenstein takes me to the last icon from his books, or at least where the icon used to be. We pass the corn dog stand, the paintball parlor, and come to a big gap covered by a chain-link fence. \"At the end of that pier over there was a roller coaster which was like a mad mouse or a wild mouse, depending on where you grew up. A tight-turn roller coaster,\" Grabenstein says. \"And this one was cool because it took you out \u2014 you were out over the ocean.\" It was the inspiration for his second mystery, <em>Mad Mouse</em>. After Superstorm Sandy hit, Grabenstein saw his beloved coaster on the front page of <em>The New York Times</em>. The pier was destroyed. And his mad mouse? \"It was this tangled wreckage,\" he says. \"Almost like a carcass out in the middle of the ocean. It was pretty horrible.\" On this sunny, summer day, the pier is a construction site, but a few rides are up and running. The rest of the boardwalk is up and running. Maybe not crowded, but surviving. They sell little bits of the storm-damaged wood in the souvenir shops. Grabenstein says it's made him rethink some things in his books. Readers want to come back to the same place over and over again, just like tourists. \"I think the attraction of shore towns is that everything is the same,\" he says. \"You know, the rides are there that you remember as a kid, and you grow up and you bring <em>your</em> kids. And I think that was what was so devastating about Sandy \u2014 it wiped out all those memories and that sense of permanence. This whole thing is built on sand and there can't be anything permanent about a shore town.\" His latest book, <em>Free Fall,</em> was at the publisher when Sandy hit, so he was only able to slip in a few lines about the storm. His narrator says that John Ceepak pulled the town through Sandy, and promised to tell that story in the next book.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

The son of a janitor, Moses was born and raised in Harlem. He's a Harvard-trained philosopher and a veteran teacher. He started a math training program \u2014 the Algebra Project \u2014 with a MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" 30 years ago. The goal is simple: Take students who score the worst on state math tests, double up on the subject for four years and get them ready to do college-level math by the end of high school. Where many teachers want students to work quietly and individually with pencil and paper, Moses encourages students to talk through tricky concepts because he says being conversational in math is a key to understanding it. Moses says the U.S. is failing to adequately fund the teaching of math. He says it shows in the kids he works with, many of whom have given up on math after doing poorly on state tests but also in the huge number of kids around the country who need remedial math courses in college. So he expects a<em> </em>lot from these students \u2014 commitment, extra summer lessons and engagement \u2014 but he's gentle with them. \"It gave me another way of looking at math,\" says Charlene Delanois, who graduated in 2010 from an Algebra Project class in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami. She says she hated math when she started, though now she's helping teach the subject to this summer's class. Delanois studies nursing, the first in her family to go to college. She still remembers the moment, a few years ago, when she was taking a test and realized that algebra had clicked for her. \"This equation came up, and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, this is the same equation we've been doing!' It just wasn't in the same format,\" she recalled. \"I was like, 'Oh, I know this, I know this!' and I figured it out, I was so proud of myself.\" Moses says this newfound competence is more than just empowering. It's how these kids can avoid being second-class citizens when they finish high school, destined for low-wage, low-skill work on the second tier of an Information Age economy. \"Education is still basically Jim Crow as far as the kids who are in the bottom economic strata of the country,\" Moses says. \"No one knows about them, no one cares about them.\" It's exactly this inequality in the education system \u2014 based more on class than race \u2014 that makes this<em> </em>work as important as the work he did 50 years ago, he says. <strong>A Northerner In The South</strong> Moses spent the early '60s working for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Mississippi. At the time, the group was struggling to make headway in the state. They faced a largely poor and rural black population who lived in terror of well-organized and often brutal white supremacists. But by 1963 things were changing. Starting that spring, Moses had sharecroppers in the Delta town of Greenwood lining up at the county courthouse, every day, to try to register to vote. After one march through town, facing down police with dogs, Moses and a handful of others were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. The ensuing trial was a spectacle. Moses remembers the courtroom packed with supporters bused in to witness. \"I'm on the witness stand, and [Federal District Judge Claude Clayton] looks at me and he says, 'Why are you taking illiterates down to register to vote?'\" Moses recalls. \"Basically we said, 'Well, look, the country can't have its cake and eat it, too. It can't have denied a whole people access to literacy and then turn around and deny people access to voting.'\" Taylor Branch, a leading historian of the civil rights era, says Moses' Northern roots, quiet demeanor and philosophical training made him different from many of the movement's decidedly Southern and evangelical leaders. \"He spoke quietly, he didn't give big sermons like Martin Luther King,\" Branch says. \"He didn't seek out dramatic confrontations like the Freedom Riders and the sit-ins, but he did inspire a broad range of grassroots leadership.\" Branch says Moses was self-effacing, observant and sensitive. He says Moses went south to serve Mississippi's sharecroppers and ended up a leader by helping to push voter registration to the center of civil rights work. \"To this day he is a startling paradox,\" Branch says. \"I think his influence is almost on par with Martin Luther King, and yet he's almost totally unknown.\" A year after Greenwood, Moses helped line up African-American candidates to run for state office in shadow elections with the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which aimed to prove that African-Americans were not at all apathetic about voting. He also spearheaded Freedom Summer, which brought white students from elite Northern colleges south. But movement progress meant increased danger. Moses was shot at and threatened. Workers were jailed and surveilled. Some were killed. \"Moses was very sensitive to the notion that people were dying by following his example,\" Branch says. \"And that led to the point where after Freedom Summer, he dropped out of the movement.\"<em></em> Moses went to Canada to avoid the draft in 1965, and then on to Tanzania, where he taught math for the better part of a decade. He returned to the U.S. in the late 1970s to finish his graduate studies at Harvard. In 1982, he launched the Algebra Project. His first high school was in Jackson, Miss. Now, three decades later, the Algebra Project has been in hundreds of classrooms across the country. The summer class he's teaching in Miami is his second cohort in the city. <strong>Training The Next Generation Of Changemakers</strong> It's the end of the day in the library at Miami Northwestern High School. The students are sitting in a big circle, talking through the day with their regular classroom teacher. Moses munches on sunflower seeds. He's clearly as comfortable listening as he is talking. One student wants to know why what she's learning doesn't look like the stuff on Florida's standardized math test. It's a question Moses hears all the time. So he jumps in, reassuring her that in the long run, standardized tests aren't what matter. \"What counts is when you leave this high school you are ready to do college math for college credit \u2014 that's what counts,\" he says emphatically. \"Trust me.\" The struggles of the '60s can seem far away today, but Moses infuses some of that history, his history, into this work. Just a couple blocks from Miami Northwestern is a short, nondescript wall, painted yellow. It's what's left of an infamous \"segregation\" wall built in 1939 to divide black and white neighborhoods. Many of his students walk by it every day but few knew its place in Miami's difficult racial history until they met Moses. Standing in front of this relic of the past, he says he's hopeful about the future. \"I've lived most of my life,\" Moses says. \"What I would like to see happen in this country in my lifetime is the next generation get ready to launch the next lurch forward.\" That next lurch forward, he says, is that every child in the country can get a quality public education and that the nation's promise of freedom continues to grow.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

This will create new entrepreneurial opportunities, says ICANN CEO Fadi Chehade. \"Diversity to the domain name system is coming,\" he says. On the Internet today, there are just 22 Web suffixes, including .org, .biz, and, of course, .com. But for years, regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission in the United States warned ICANN against forging ahead, citing concerns about the increased possibility of scams, fraud and trademark infringement with a vast and rapid expansion. For example, imagine anyone besides Hilton owning Hilton.hotels. Or consider transferring money using a site ending in a misspelled version of .wellsfargo. You begin to get a sense of the potential pitfalls. ICANN says it has addressed such concerns. It is establishing a global trademark clearinghouse Chehade says will help prevent violations. Users will also be able to report abuse, and everyone registered to use the new domains will be bound by ethical rules laid out in contracts. \"We have a whole regime of enforcement,\" Chehade says, \"leading all the way up to revoking.\" Chehade acknowledges there will always be bad actors. But more importantly, he says, the expansion is necessary to make the Web more usable for people in non-English-speaking countries. For example, Egypt, which navigates the Web with difficulty, Chehade says. \"I have many [Egyptians] who are relatives who don't even have a Latin keyboard,\" he says. \"I think it's remarkable that we're finally allowing them to type left to right, in their own script. I think this is a very visible way to make the Internet a global resource.\" But not everyone believes this will revolutionize the Web. Deepu Krishnan is a manager at MBA Fakhro Voyager, a conglomerate of Internet firms based in Bahrain. Though social media use is big in the Middle East, Krishnan says Internet usage is still predominantly for business. The region is heavily dependent on imports and has large expatriate populations. And Krishnan says he doesn't anticipate many will abandon the traditional Roman-letter websites for Arabic versions \u2014 if nothing else, because the switch would limit the ability to communicate internationally. \"They don't want to share an e-mail ending with .Arabic to their client in the United States,\" he says, And with so many new available addresses on the Internet, will the Web become harder to navigate? Opinion is divided. People are so habituated to typing .com that that will remain the premium domain, says Chris Sherman, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a publication devoted to search. \"I don't think it's going to fundamentally change how people use search engines or actually find content on the Web,\" he says. Elisa Cooper disagrees. Cooper is director of product marketing for MarkMonitor, a firm that does online brand protection for major companies. \"I think there will definitely be a lot of consumer confusion to start,\" she says. Cooper says many of her clients are concerned consumers will get confused about finding the right brands. Companies plan to buy domain names in various iterations in order to protect their brands from abuse. But with so many new permutations and combinations possible, many are having to take a different approach. \"Trying to register misspellings and variations and 'typosquats' across 700 registries is quickly going to become cost-prohibitive,\" Cooper says. It will be a particular challenge for small businesses, she says, because many of them aren't aware of the pending change and don't have the deep pockets of large corporations. \"They likely won't have the resources to do the policing to identify the abuse and then take action,\" she says. All 1,400 new top-level domains will be introduced within a year and a half.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.
